The attached file ( attachment:ransac.py ) implements the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RANSAC RANSAC algorithm]. An example image:

To run the file, save it to your computer, start IPython
{{{
ipython -wthread
}}}

Import the module and run the test program

{{{#!python
import ransac 
ransac.test()
}}}

To use the module you need to create a model class with two methods

{{{#!python
def fit(self, data):
  """Given the data fit the data with your model and return the model (a vector)"""
def get_error(self, data, model):
  """Given a set of data and a model, what is the error of using this model to estimate the data """
}}}

An example of such model is the class LinearLeastSquaresModel as seen the file source (below)
