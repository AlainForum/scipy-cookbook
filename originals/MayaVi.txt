[http://code.enthought.com/projects/mayavi/ Mayavi2] is a interactive program allowing elaborate 3D plots of scientific data in Python with scipy.
It is the successor of [http://mayavi.sf.net MayaVi] for 3D visualization. 


||<#80FF80> The information on this page is a bit old and outdated. You are invited to refer to the [http://enthought.github.com/mayavi/mayavi/ Mayavi2 user guide] as a reference. For a quick introduction to scripting, see [http://enthought.github.com/mayavi/mayavi/mlab.html mlab]. In recent versions of Mayavi2, the user guide can be accessed in the help menu, but the user guide for the latest version of Mayavi can also be found [http://enthought.github.com/mayavi/mayavi/ on line]. ||


If you need more help, you are invited to ask questions on the [https://mail.enthought.com/mailman/listinfo/enthought-dev Enthought-dev] mailing list.
