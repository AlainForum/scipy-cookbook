      "I've written several C extensions that handle NumPy arrays.  They are simple, but they seem to work well. They will show you how to pass Python variables and NumPy arrays to your C code. Once you learn how to do it, it's pretty straight-forward. I suspect they will suffice for most numerical code.  I've written it up as a draft and have made the code and document file available. I found for my numerical needs I really only need to pass a limited set of things (integers, floats, strings, and NumPy arrays).  If that's your category, this code might help you.\n",

      "C Extensions to NumPy and Python\n",
      "--------------------------------\n",

      "By Lou Pecora - 2006-12-07 (Draft version 0.1)\n",
      "\n",
      "Overview\n",
      "---------\n",
      "\n",
      "### Introduction\u2013 a little background\n",
      "\n",
      "In my use of Python I came across a typical problem: I needed to speed up particular parts of my code. I am not a Python guru or any kind of coding/computer guru. I use Python for numerical calculations and I make heavy use of Numeric/NumPy. Almost every Python book or tutorial tells you build C extensions to Python when you need a routine to run fast. C extensions are C code that can be compiled and linked to a shared library that can be imported like any Python module and you can call specified C routines like they were Python functions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sounds nice, but I had reservations. It looked non-trivial (it is, to an extent). So I searched for other solutions. I found them. They are such approaches as [SWIG](http://www.swig.org/), [Pyrex](http://www.cosc.canterbury.ac.nz/greg.ewing/python/Pyrex/), [ctypes](http://python.net/crew/theller/ctypes/), [Psyco](http://psyco.sourceforge.net/), and [Weave](http://www.scipy.org/Weave). I often got the simple examples given to work (not all, however) when I tried these. But I hit a barrier when I tried to apply them to NumPy. Then one gets into typemaps or other hybrid constructs. I am not knocking these approaches, but I could never figure them out and get going on my own code despite lots of online tutorials and helpful suggestions from various Python support groups and emailing lists.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I decided to see if I could just write my own C extensions. I got help in the form of some simple C extension examples for using Numeric written about 2000 from Tom Loredo of Cornell university. These sat on my hard drive until 5 years later out of desperation I pulled them out and using his examples, I was able to quickly put together several C extensions that (at least for me) handle all of the cases (so far) where I want a speedup.   These cases mostly involve passing Python integers, floats (=C doubles), strings, and NumPy 1D and 2D float and integer arrays. I rarely need to pass anything else to a C routine to do  a calculation. If you are in the same situation as me, then this package I put together might help you. It turns out to be fairly easy once you get going.\n",
      "\n",
      "Please note, Tom Loredo is not responsible for any errors in my code or instructions although I am deeply indebted to him. Likewise, this code is for research only. It was tested by only my development and usage. It is not guaranteed, and comes with no warranty. Do not use this code where there are any threats of loss of life, limb, property, or money or anything you or others hold dear.\n",
      "\n",
      "I developed these C extensions and their Python wrappers on a Macintosh G4 laptop using system OS X 10.4 (essential BSD Unix), Python 2.4, NumPy 0.9x, and the gnu compiler and linker gcc. I think most of what I tell you here will be easily translated to Linux and other Unix systems beyond the Mac. I am not sure about Windows. I hope that my low-level approach will make it easy for Windows users, too.\n",
      "\n",
      "The code (both C and Python) for the extensions may look like a lot, but it is *very* repetitious. Once you get the main scheme for one extension function you will see that repeated over and over again in all the others with minor variations to handle different arguments or return different objects to the calling routine. Don't be put off by the code. The good news is that for many numerical uses extensions will follow the same format so you can quickly reuse what you already have written for new projects. Focus on one extension function and follow it in detail (in fact, I will do this below). Once you understand it,  the other routines will be almost obvious. The same is true of the several utility functions that come with the package. They help you create, test, and manipulate the data and they also have a lot of repetition. The utility functions are also very short and simple so nothing to fear there.\n",
      "\n",
      "### General Scheme for NumPy Extensions\n",
      "\n",
      "This will be covered in detail below, but first I wanted to give you a sense of how each extension is organized.\n",
      "\n",
      "Three things that must be done before your C extension functions in the C source file.\n",
      "\n",
      " 1. You must include Python and NumPy headers.\n",
      "\n",
      " 2. Each extension must be named in a defining structure at the beginning of the file. This is a name used to access the extension from a Python function.\n",
      "\n",
      " 3. Next an initialization set of calls is made to set up the Python and NumPy calls and interface. It will be the same for all extensions involving NumPy and Python unless you add extensions to access other Python packages or classes beyond NumPy arrays. I will not cover any of that here (because I don't know it). So the init calls can be copied to each extension file.\n",
      "\n",
      "Each C extension will have the following form.\n",
      "\n",
      "* The arguments will always be the same: (`PyObject *self`, `PyObject *args`) - Don't worry if you don't know what exactly these are. They are pointers to general Python objects and they are automatically provided by the header files you will use from NumPy and Python itself. You need know no more than that.\n",
      "\n",
      "* The args get processed by a function call that parses them and assigns them to C defined objects.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Next the results of that parse might be checked by a utility routine that reaches into the structure representing the object and makes sure the data is the right kind (float or int, 1D or 2D array, etc.). Although I included some of these C-level checks, you will see that I think they are better done in Python functions that are used to wrap the C extensions. They are also a lot easier to do in Python. I have plenty of data checks in my calling Python wrappers. Usually this does not lead to much overhead since you are not calling these extensions billions of times in some loop, but using them as a portal to a C or C++ routine to do a long, complex, repetitive, specialized calculation.\n",
      "\n",
      "* After some possible data checks, C data types are initialized to point to the data part of the NumPy arrays with the help of utility functions.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Next dimension information is extracted so you know the number of columns, rows, vector dimensions, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Now you can use the C arrays to manipulate the data in the NumPy arrays. The C arrays and C data from the above parse point to the original Python/NumPy data so changes you make affect the array values when you go back to Python after the extension returns. You can pass the arrays to other C functions that do calculations, etc. Just remember you are operating on the original NumPy matrices and vectors.\n",
      "\n",
      "* After your calculation you have to free any memory allocated in the construction of your C data for the NumPy arrays. This is done again by Utility functions. This step is only necessary if you allocated memory to handle the arrays (e.g. in the matrix routines), but is not necessary if you have not allocated memory (e.g. in the vector routines).\n",
      "\n",
      "* Finally, you return to the Python calling function, by returning a Python value or NumPy array. I have C extensions which show examples of both.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Python Wrapper Functions\n",
      "\n",
      "It is best to call the C extensions by calling a Python function that then calls the extension. This is called a Python wrapper function. It puts a more pythonic look to your code (e.g. you can use keywords easily) and, as I pointed out above, allows you to easily check that the function arguments and data are correct before you had them over to the C extension and other C functions for that big calculation. It may seem like an unnecessary extra step, but it's worth it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Code\n",
      "--------\n",
      "\n",
      "In this section I refer to the code in the source files `C_arraytest.h`, `C_arraytest.c`, `C_arraytest.py`, and `C_arraytest.mak`. You should keep those files handy (probably printed out) so you can follow the explanations of the code below.\n",
      "\n",
      "### The C Code \u2013 one detailed example with utilities\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I will use the example of code from C_arraytest.h, C_arraytest.c for the routine called matsq.

The variable `dfactor` will be the Python float y, `ifactor` will be the Python int i, the variables i,j,n, and m will be loop variables (i and j) and matrix dimensions (n= number of rows, m= number of columns) in A and B.

Note you must pass all C variables by reference. This is true even if the C variable is a pointer to a string (see code in vecfcn1 routine). The format string tells the parsing function what type of variable to use. The common variables for Python all have letter names (e.g. s for string, i for integer, d for (double - the Python float)). You can find a list of these and many more in Guido's tutorial (http://docs.python.org/ext/ext.html).   For data types that are not in standard Python like the NumPy arrays you use the O! notation which tells the parser to look for a type structure (in this case a NumPy structure `PyArray_Type`) to help it convert the tuple member that will be assigned to the local variable ( matin ) pointing to the NumPy array structure. Note these are also passed by reference. The order must be maintained and match the calling interface of the Python function you want. The format string defines the interface and if you do not call the function from Python so the number of arguments match the number in the format string, you will get an error.

I suspect names like `NPY_DOUBLE`, for example, will not be. I strongly suggest you upgrade to the NumPy since it is the future of Numeric in Python.  It's worth the effort.\n",
